# Odin-Recipes I finally got it down on how to get limks connected across different files in the relative domain I am working on and I now know by heart how to link images based on the corresponding folder. I had an absolute blast with this project given that I got to utilize my creativity albeit limited for now due to my limited knowledge of coding. Nonetheless, I am very proud of what I have accomplished and I am very excited for what's to come in the future for my web development journey!
